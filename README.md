ActivateTIM Script

This script allows you to activate your INSIKA smart card. It is written for the [SmartCardShell3](http://www.openscdp.org/scsh3/).

Get started by downloading the version 3.7.1062 of the [SmartCardShell3.7.1062](http://www.openscdp.org/scsh3/download.html).
Unzip and run the Windows installer or unzip the ZIP archive to a destination of your choice.

Start the SmartCardShell3.

Insert the INSIKA smart card into the reader and load the ActivateTIM.js script. A dialog window opens and you are asked to enter the Transport PIN. Then the INSIKA smart card will be activated.
